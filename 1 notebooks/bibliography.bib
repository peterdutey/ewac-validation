abstract = {The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is an instrument used to screen for alcohol-related problems. It has been increasingly used in many different countries in both the original English-language version and its many translated versions. Because of the need for screening instruments of faster administration, shortened versions of the AUDIT have also been developed. This study was aimed at expanding the work by Berner and colleagues (2007) in an attempt to answer some remaining questions as well as to identify and evaluate studies on the validation of modified versions of the AUDIT, which have not been previously analyzed. In order to do so, we identified indexed articles published between 2002 and 2009 related to the psychometric qualities of the AUDIT by matching the keywords: alcohol, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, and AUDIT. We found 47 articles that evaluated the AUDIT in different countries and in diverse health and community contexts, involving adolescent, adult, and elderly samples. The studies confirmed the validity and efficiency of the AUDIT in the identification of harmful use, abuse, and dependence of alcohol, both in the original version and in modified ones. The possibility of using brief and efficient versions is of great value, since certain health contexts demand faster assessment. The results also showed that the reduced versions have satisfactory psychometric qualities, sometimes with sensitivity values higher than those of the AUDIT itself. The studies analyzed confirm the efficiency of the AUDIT both in its original, reduced, and language-adapted versions in different contexts and cultures.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of different brief intervention strategies at reducing hazardous or harmful drinking in primary care. The hypothesis was that more intensive intervention would result in a greater reduction in hazardous or harmful drinking. Design Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting Primary care practices in the north east and south east of England and in London. Participants 3562 patients aged 18 or more routinely presenting in primary care, of whom 2991 (84.0{\%}) were eligible to enter the trial: 900 (30.1{\%}) screened positive for hazardous or harmful drinking and 756 (84.0{\%}) received a brief intervention. The sample was predominantly male (62{\%}) and white (92{\%}), and 34{\%} were current smokers. Interventions Practices were randomised to three interventions, each of which built on the previous one: a patient information leaflet control group, five minutes of structured brief advice, and 20 minutes of brief lifestyle counselling. Delivery of the patient leaflet and brief advice occurred directly after screening and brief lifestyle counselling in a subsequent consultation. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was patients' self reported hazardous or harmful drinking status as measured by the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) at six months. A negative AUDIT result (score {\textless}8) indicated non-hazardous or non-harmful drinking. Secondary outcomes were a negative AUDIT result at 12 months, experience of alcohol related problems (alcohol problems questionnaire), health utility (EQ-5D), service utilisation, and patients' motivation to change drinking behaviour (readiness to change) as measured by a modified readiness ruler. Results Patient follow-up rates were 83{\%} at six months (n=644) and 79{\%} at 12 months (n=617). At both time points an intention to treat analysis found no significant differences in AUDIT negative status between the three interventions. Compared with the patient information leaflet group, the odds ratio of having a negative AUDIT result for brief advice was 0.85 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.52 to 1.39) and for brief lifestyle counselling was 0.78 (0.48 to 1.25). A per protocol analysis confirmed these findings. Conclusions All patients received simple feedback on their screening outcome. Beyond this input, however, evidence that brief advice or brief lifestyle counselling provided important additional benefit in reducing hazardous or harmful drinking compared with the patient information leaflet was lacking.},

@article{Beard2015a,
abstract = {Background: Timely tracking of national patterns of alcohol consumption is needed to inform and evaluate strategies and policies aimed at reducing alcohol-related harm. Between 2014 until at least 2017, the Alcohol Toolkit Study (ATS) will provide such tracking data and link these with policy changes and campaigns. By virtue of its connection with the 'Smoking Toolkit Study' (STS), links will also be examined between alcohol and smoking-related behaviour. Methods/Design: The ATS consists of cross-sectional household, computer-assisted interviews of representative samples of adults in England aged 16+. Each month a new sample of approximately 1800 adults complete the survey ({\~{}}n∈=∈21,600 per year). All respondents who consent to be followed-up are asked to complete a telephone survey 6 months later. The ATS has been funded to collect at least 36 waves of baseline and 6-month follow-up data across a period of 3 years. Questions cover alcohol consumption and related harm (AUDIT), socio-demographic characteristics, attempts to reduce or cease consumption and factors associated with this, and exposure to health professional advice on alcohol. The ATS complements the STS, which has been tracking key performance indicators relating to smoking since 2006. As both the ATS and STS involve the same respondents, it is possible to assess interactions between changes in alcohol and tobacco use. Data analysis will involve: 1) Descriptive and exploratory analyses undertaken according to a pre-defined set of principles while allowing scope for pursuing lines of enquiry that arise from prior analyses; 2) Hypothesis testing according to pre-specified, published analysis plans. Descriptive data on important trends will be published monthly on a dedicated website: www.alcoholinengland.info. Discussion: The Alcohol Toolkit Study will improve understanding of population level factors influencing alcohol consumption and be an important resource for policy evaluation and planning. {\textcopyright} 2015 Beard et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

@article{Lemmens1992,
abstract = {This article compares five indices of alcohol consumption in a general population survey conducted in 1985 in the Netherlands. Self-reports of consumption were obtained with a prospective diary, a retrospective 7-day recall method, and three summary measures, such as a quantity-frequency index. The coverage of sales data appeared highest for the diary (67{\%}), which suggests a higher validity. Special attention was given to comparisons of quantity and frequency of drinking between the diary, on the one hand, and the weekly recall and summary measures, on the other. It was found that underreporting, relative to the diary reports, was generally higher in the frequency than in the quantity domain. This result, together with the finding from longitudinal studies that intraindividual variation is also higher for drinking frequency, leads to the conclusion that forgetting is a potent source of undercoverage in surveys and to the hypothesis that large differences in overall drinking pattern between populations (e.g., in regularity of drinking) may account for the large differences in coverage rates of sales data. Furthermore, the subjectively assessed probability of drinking by means of a "usual" frequency question appeared a poor predictor of (diary) drinking frequency for respondents reporting a low or moderate frequency. For subjects claiming a high "usual" drinking frequency, a reasonable correspondence between diary and summary measures was found. This mitigates the fear often expressed that heavy drinkers particularly underreport their consumption.},

@article{Feunekes1999,
abstract = {Recent recommendations in regard to the level of alcohol intake have mainly been based on epidemiologic studies which relied on self-reported amounts of alcohol consumed. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the quality of self-reported measures of alcohol intake. Alcohol intake assessment methods were reviewed with respect to their capacity to rank individuals according to alcohol intake and their ability to explain the variation in the level of intake in population samples. In 33 methodological papers published after 1984, alcohol intake was assessed by five main methods: quantity frequency, extended quantity frequency, retrospective diary, prospective diary, and 24-hour recalls. The mean level of alcohol intake differed by 20{\%} between these methods. It was also found that when researchers asked specifically about intake of beer, wine, and liquor, this resulted in 20{\%} higher estimates of intake. These percentages were similar among populations with low and high mean alcohol consumption (4 vs. 10 drinks per week). It was found that ranking of individuals according to intake was satisfactory, with weighted correlation coefficients between methods ranging from 0.63 to 0.73. The authors conclude that, when there is sufficient evidence that alcohol intake is underestimated in a population, methods that enquire about both the frequency and amount consumed, for beer, wine, and liquor, separately, will yield the most realistic levels of intake.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Under-reporting of alcohol consumption is widespread; surveys typically capture 40-60{\%} of alcohol sales. However the population distribution of under-reporting is not well understood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Mixed-methods study to identify factors associated with under-reporting, using the nationally-representative Health Survey for England (HSE) 2011 (overall response rate 66{\%}). Comparison of retrospective computer-assisted personal interview and seven-day drinking diary (n = 3,774 adults 18+, 50{\%} women, diary response rate 69{\%}) to identify factors associated with diary responses exceeding those of the interview using multivariable linear regression for three outcomes: drinking days in the week recorded, volume consumed on heaviest drinking day in the week recorded, and weekly alcohol consumption. Qualitative semi-structured interviews (n = 10) explored reasons for under-reporting in further detail.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Number of drinking days was slightly greater in the diary than the interview (P {\textless} 0.001). Reported consumption was higher in the diary than in the interview for heaviest drinking day in the week recorded (0.7 units greater among men, 1.2 units among women, P {\textless} 0.001), and weekly alcohol consumption in women only (1.1 units among women, P = 0.003). Participants who drank more frequently, more heavily, and had a more varied drinking pattern with respect to the types of drink consumed or choice of drinking venues had a larger difference between their diary week and their interview week.The qualitative interviews identified having a non-routine drinking pattern, self-perception as a non-frequent drinker, and usually tracking drinking using experiential approaches as linked to more drinking being reported in the diary than the retrospective interview.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Heavy drinking and non-routine drinking patterns may be associated with greater under-reporting of alcohol consumption. Estimates of drinking above recommended levels are likely to be disproportionately under-estimated.},

Observed drinking frequencies for different age and gender groups were calculated from BSY and used to correct values of F in QF. Beverage-specific correction factors for quantity (Q) were calculated by comparing consumption estimated from BSY with sales data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nResults$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDrinking frequency was underestimated by males (Z=24.62, p{\textless}0.001) and females (Z=17.46, p{\textless}0.001) in the QF as assessed by comparing with frequency and quantity of Yesterday drinking. Spirits consumption was underestimated by 65.94{\%} compared with sales data, wine by 38.35{\%} and beer by 49.02{\%}. After adjusting Q and F values accordingly, regression analysis found alcohol consumption to be under-estimated significantly more by younger drinkers (e.g.82.9 ±1.19{\%} for underage drinkers vs 70.38 ±1.54{\%} for those 65+, p{\textless}0.001) and by low risk more than high risk drinkers (76.25 ±0.34{\%} vs 49.22 ±3.01{\%}, p{\textless}0.001).

Recent recall methods encourage fuller reporting of volumes plus more accurate estimates of unrecorded consumption and the proportion of total alcohol consumption that places drinkers at risk of harm. However, they do not capture longer-term drinking patterns. It is recommended that both recent recall and measures of longer-term drinking patterns are included in national surveys.},
