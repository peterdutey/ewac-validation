The third run mixes a little better, but remains too slow.
In addition the Q coefficients just don't converge at all, suggesting a bigger problem here (mentioned the potential gender interaction before).

To do:
- move from uniform to more informative priors based on a beta(2,2) density to hopefully facilitate convergence
- investigate the gender difference in Q coefficients using the simpler fitting approach and review
- allow for overlap between Q5 and Q6 as Q6 is definitely still hitting the lower bound of its prior.
